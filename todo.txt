move compass away from micro board

make a pid controller for tilt to autopilot based on tilt
look up how to get the tilt only reading

---------------------make it so that you can one key change course by one degree port and starboard

-----------------make the ok activate and scroll thru main menu

--------------------make the current course show at least update once a second

--------------------fix freezes probable on bailouts

add alarm when 20-30 degrees off course

-------------make it so the derivative in PID doesnt start for a few seconds when autopilot starts
----------------make it so the integral in PID doesnt start for a few seconds when autopilot starts
